<font color="00B394">Maker Goblin</font> is a platform that aims to teach young learners ages three to seven to be creative with found objects by creating stories that can be shared with other learners. These objects could range anywhere from jar lids to marbles to shells. The concept behind Maker Goblin is driven by the maker culture, which emphasizes a participatory approach, peer-led, and shared learning that is fun and relevant to learners. 
The concept behind the brand was to create a character that would be distinguishable by its building-block/patched-style, where the different colours represent the idea of constructing from different materials. This style was also brought into the wordmark, marketing and collateral material.
