<font color="00B394">Gardiner Poncia and Associates</font> is an educational technology consulting company that works for ed tech companies, schools, publishers and non profits. We worked with the idea of a symbol representing a coral reef because of the idea of a school community, where fish are like schools and the reef is the community. The coral reef was knocked out on a dynamic, abstract pattern that represents the engaging atmosphere involved with learning.
