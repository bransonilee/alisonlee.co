<font color="00B394">The Inuit Art Museum</font> focuses on the history, traditions, and significance of Inuit art and culture. The new identity represents a balance of today’s Inuit art with long-standing practices from the past, as well as the future of this art style.
The Inuit people have a very unique writing system that was incorporated into the logo. The phrase that these characters were derived from spells out the Inuktitut phrase for “artistically done”. By constructing a face, it aims to represent the idea of approachability and to create a connection between this institution, the art, and its visitors.
A series of Inuit characters were also developed for use across the visual identity. As the Inuit art style is very broad, an organic and smooth style seemed to be consistent throughout many of their artworks and was the basis of the design of these characters. These characters are representative of Inuit life and culture that are still important aspects today.
