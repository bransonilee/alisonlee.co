Food is one of the most influential and important products that we have. It is understood by every human being and therefore, this material opens new doors into the possibilities between food and design. Food and eating design is focused on enhancing and changing one's experience with food – not necessarily about the presentation of food itself.
Food Plus Design is a conference targeted towards those in the design and food industry, whether it be professionals or students. It is meant to bring attention to the growing disciplines of food and eating design and to inspire designers and food professionals to design experiences around food. The branding focuses on the relationship and intersections of food and design. To create a unified identity, all graphic elements are two colour and an illustrative style was chosen to complement the logo. A pair of contrasting colours were selected as not representative of food, but instead, to stand for the innovative ideas behind the disciplines of food and eating design.
The fluid nature of the logo allows for easy application across the branding, such as in a backdrop design or on t-shirts.
