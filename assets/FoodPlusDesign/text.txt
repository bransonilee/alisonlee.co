<font color="00B394">Food Plus Design</font> is a conference for the disciplines of food and eating design&mdash;two growing fields that aims to enhance and change one's experience with food. The branding for this conference is focused on the relationship and intersection of food and design. To create a unified identity, all graphic elements are two colour and an illustrative line drawing style was chosen to complement the logo. A pair of contrasting colours were selected as not representative of food, but instead, to stand for the innovative ideas behind the disciplines of food and eating design.
